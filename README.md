# CHIP-8
This was my first time trying out making an emulator, so I tried out chip-8! I later want to try making a Game Boy emulator, so I wanted to start off simple. I followed [this](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/) tutorial which was really helpful without spoonfeeding the code!
